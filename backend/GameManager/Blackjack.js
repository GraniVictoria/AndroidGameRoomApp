/*
1. Blackjack is a card game played between the House (dealer) and the players. The dealer deals two cards to each player and two to themselves, with one facing up and one facing down.

2. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total point value of 21. The value of each card is as follows: 2-10 (as it is), Jack, Queen, King (each worth 10 points) and Ace (either 1 or 11, if adding 11 breaks 21, it's counted as 1).

3. After receiving the first two cards, players can choose to "Stand" (keep their current cards), "Hit" (receive another card)

4. Once all players have completed their turns, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer must always hit until they have a total of 17 or higher.

5. If the player's hand exceeds 21 (busting), they automatically lose, no matter what the dealer's hand is.

6. The game continues with players trying to reach a score of 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

Winning:
1. If the player has Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card as their first two cards) and the dealer does not, the player automatically wins

2. If the player has a final sum closer to 21 and it is higher than the dealerâ€™s total, or if the dealer goes over 21 (busts), the player wins.

3. If both, the player and dealer, have the same point value in their hands, it is a tie

4. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 or the player's hand goes over 21 (bust), the player loses the bet placed.

Unique:
in this version of the game, dealer will be computer and will stop whenever he hit 17+ or bust
